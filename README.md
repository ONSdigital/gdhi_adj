# Reproducible Analytical Pipeline Example Framework

The Reproducible Analytical Pipelines Example Framework serves as both a template and a toolkit for starting new statistical pipelines in the Reproducible Data Science & Analysis team. It is structured to work as a template that you can start adding your code to right away, with tools for using git for version control, Jenkins for automated unit testing and releases, and Sphinx for generating documentation with rich features, all with documentation and walkthrough-style guides.

For quick setup of a new project, copy or download `first_time_setup.sh` into a blank CDSW project, then run it using the `bash` command and follow the instructions. For more detailed information, [see the wiki](https://gitlab-app-l-01/EPDS/rap-project-example/-/wikis/home).
